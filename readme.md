# sounddroid

sounddroid is an **extremely basic** soundcloud client for android. it supports listening to tracks and searching for tracks but that's it. i built this as a small project.

the default list shown contains the most recent tracks posted to soundcloud.

built with the [retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/), [gson](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/), and [picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) frameworks.
